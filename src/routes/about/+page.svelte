            So here's the short version to get some basic content on this
            page, full auto-biography coming soon(tm)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, UK. Grew up with a passion for
            computers and technology. Played about with coding and
            ActionScript 2.0 in high school and a bit of PHP in college. Wanted
            to go to University to study computer science and get into
            programming, but it didn't work out.

            Worked in retail for about 10 and a half years, moved to
            Nottingham halfway through that to live with friends. In 2019, I
            eventually got my big break out of retail and into IT. It was
            basic first line tech support, but it was a start, it gave me the
            experience I needed on my CV in lack of a qualification. 2020 hits
            I break up with my partner who I was living with at the time. We
            decide it's best for working from home from my parents instead, so
            back to Great Yarmouth. I then pick up a new and better job here,
            it's a support job again, but it's their own software, so I get to
            work on a lot more and see/tweak the source code if needed.

            Nearly a year into the job, I've expressed an interest in moving
            from support over to development (as was my initial aspired job
            path which I'd dismissed as unobtainable). The plans are now in
            motion to move over from next year, but in the meantime I've been
            preparing myself by refreshing my already existing knowledge of
            HTML/CSS and learning JavaScript (Which to my benefit was a heavy
            source of inspiration for ActionScript which I had done in High
            School)

            My background on photography was covered pretty well on my first
            photography blog post, which in hindsight I should have probably backed up before shutting it all down.
            That hobby has been on hold a bit lately, so will rewrite this section should it become more an interest to me again.
