            I'm not going to make excuses this time, I can just find it hard to motivate myself to work on this site in just raw HTML and CSS.
            <br />
            What is here now, is an initial porting of what I already had into SvelteKit and using it to generate static pages, which will be a bit nicer for me to work with (reusable components etc).
